This is a toy application for workshop on RoR optimisation.

## The story

We have 10k users and 500k sessions.

Our boss wants to see a report for 30 days for all users.

But it works painfully slow.

So he asks us to be able to open this report:
- for 30 days
- for 30 first users at least
- in < 5 seconds

In our workshop we will tackle these requirements in a systematic approach.
